# Admission-Form
I’m excited to share a recent project I worked on — I’ve designed and developed a fully functional Admission Form for Sardar Beant Singh State University using HTML and CSS. 📄💻

👉 The goal of this project was to create a simple, responsive, and user-friendly form to collect student details during the admission process. It includes essential fields such as:

Full Name

Email

Contact Number

Course Selection

Gender

File Upload (for documents)

✨ Key Features:

Clean and modern UI using custom CSS

Responsive layout for different screen sizes

Basic form validation

Organized structure and intuitive design for better user experience

Through this project, I got hands-on experience in writing clean HTML structure, styling with CSS, and understanding the importance of accessibility and usability in forms. It's a small but meaningful step in improving digital interactions for educational institutions.

🔧 Tech Used: HTML5, CSS3
📍 Institution: Sardar Beant Singh State University
🛠️ Currently working on adding JavaScript functionality to enhance validation and interactivity!

This was a valuable learning experience, and I’m looking forward to building more real-world web projects that can make a difference.

Feel free to check it out or connect if you're working on something similar!
